# date-formats
A reference for how to format that date

### A quick reference for how to format a date

The intention is for this site to become a complete reference for how to format a date, in all common and uncommon formats for as many programming languages as we can.


#### Contribute

I need help getting this started.

The site is built in Jekyll, and all languages are posts.

To add a new languge make a new post in the format of: ``` 2015-06-20-{language}.md ``` and add the following to the top of the file:

```
---
layout: page
title:  "{language}"
date:   2015-06-20 21:34:21
categories: lang
---

# {language}  formats
```

Then follow this convention to make a table to show the dates format arguments and their output:
```
argument   | output
-----------|-------
```{arg}```| {out}

```
